# Project 2: Design Journey

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in VS Code's Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it.

## Catalog (Milestone 1)

### Describe your Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your collection be about? What types of attributes will you keep track of for the *things* in your catalog? 1-2 sentences.
My collection will be a catalog for professional or career-related clubs and student organizations at Cornell. I will keep track of the name of each club or student organization, the type of career the club is related to, its mission, and website link.

### Target Audience(s) (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your target audience(s).
My target audiences will be students who are interested in joining a new club on campus and the members of clubs who want their club to be included on my catalog. It's important that the catalog isn't overwhelming and doesn't discourage students from wanting to join a club. Additionally, it's important that club members feel that their website is accurately and fully represented on my catalog.


### Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Review some existing catalog that are similar to yours. List the catalog's you reviewed here. Write a small reflection on how you might use the design patterns you identified in your review in your own catalog.
* Cornell CampusGroups Catalog

I will include the search bar and categories the user can filter by at the top of the page like Cornell CampusGroups did. Then, the search bar will be the first thing the user sees. This is important because most users will probably want to use the filter or search functionality instead of searching through the entire list of clubs. They will want to filter the clubs to only see the clubs related to their major or career path. Instead of just displaying the URL, each club also has a button for their website so the user can easily visit it. The user must click on the name of the club to be directed to a page with more information about it. This is a better alternative to displaying the description of every club in the catalog, which would look crowded and dense.

## Design & Planning (Milestone 2)

## Design Process (Milestone 2)
> Document your design process. Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to design you wish to implement (sketch). Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation, if applicable.
> Label all images. All labels must be visible in VS Code's Markdown Preview.
> Clearly label the final design.


## Partials (Milestone 2)
> If you have any partials, plan them here.


## Database Schema (Milestone 2)
> Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this. Make sure you include constraints for each field.

Table: movies
- field 1: description..., constraints...
- field...


## Database Query Plan (Milestone 2)
> Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]

1. All records

    ```
    TODO
    ```

2. Search records

    ```
    TODO
    ```

3. Insert record

    ```
    TODO
    ```


## Code Planning (Milestone 2)
> Plan any PHP code you'll need here.


# Reflection (Final Submission)
> Take this time to reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved since Project 1? What things did you have trouble with?
